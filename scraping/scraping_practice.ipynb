       "{'0114709': [\"Toy Story is not only the best Disney film because it has the best story and the best animation, but also because of the excellent actors chosen to provide the voices of the animals. The casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nail-biting climax.\\nTom Hanks and Tim Allen provided excellent voices for Woody and Buzz Lightyear -their performances alone are one of the biggest things that made this such a spectacular movie. Besides that, though, you have the excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told from this perspective before, but also because it was just told so well. All of the characters in the film are very well developed and all have appropriate and effective actors chosen to provide their voices. And of course, who could forget the revolutionary animation! The computer animation used for this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons of possibilities, and thankfully the filmmakers chose to explore these possibilities. There are dozens of things that are hidden in the woodwork throughout the film, as well as in the songs \\x96 note, for example, the subtle playing of the Indiana Jones theme song in the scene where Woody knocks Buzz out the window with the desk lamp.\\nToy Story is by far the best Disney film ever made, it's pretty much perfect. It's adventurous, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's good for the whole family, it's got great characters, story, and plot, and above all, it's fun.\",\n",
       "  'I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy\\'s birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don\\'t want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he\\'s the most popular one of them all. He\\'s the only one that hasn\\'t got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren\\'t always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that\\'s true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren\\'t yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10.',\n",
       "  'This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it\\'s routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as \"Woody\" and Allen as \"Buzz Armstrong,\" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don\\'t diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed \"winner\" as is the sequel.',\n",
       "  \"Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!\",\n",
       "  'I was well prepared to like this movie on the basis of the art alone, and the art did not disappoint.  However, I found much of the humor to be based on cruelty, and I was truly horrified by the overall message of the film: \"Lower your expectations for yourself and everything will work out fine.\" It reminded me of The Breakfast Club, whose main theme seemed to be \"Conform to the style of the popular kids, and all your problems will dissipate.\" This is just so wrong.  If you want to see really good computer animation that will amuse you, inspire your children to be good and strong and true, and which predates this  shallow and uninspiring vehicle, check out the television series Reboot, now being re-run on Cartoon Network.  This movie is only good for refreshing your mental catalog of toys you may have once owned.',\n",

       "  'I don\\'t understand why this film is so highly rated. The film has so many plot holes in it I actually lost count. Now before I start this review, I\\'m not going to say toys talking is a plot hole, the idea of them talking is interesting but it opens up so many other questions that the movie never really explains. Also, don\\'t argue, \"it\\'s a kids movie\", films need to make sense in order to work whether they\\'re for kids or not. This film is so bad and here is why. Even if you like this film, you have to agree with some of the points I\\'m making here:Buzz thinks he\\'s a space ranger. If that is the case then why does he allow Andy to play with him? Does he not think why is this giant kid picking me up and throwing me around? Buzz however makes no attempt to communicate with Andy. Surely Buzz would try and talk to him? This doesn\\'t make sense given that Buzz doesn\\'t believe he\\'s a toy. Also when Woody hits a button that release Buzz\\'s helmet and he gasps for air, you\\'re telling me Andy never pushed that button? He\\'s owned the toy for weeks yet hadn\\'t pressed all the buttons? Rubbish.The end scene is one of the worst scenes for me. It\\'s broad daylight and two toys are running down a street. Where are all the pedestrians on the street? How are they able to open the back of the moving van truck? Surely the driver would notice doesn\\'t he check his rear view mirrors, or surely a button or signal would come up revealing that a door was open at the back of his truck? Wow any thief could steal from this useless driver. Also when Woody and Buzz fly down from the sky and land in Andy\\'s car. Andy\\'s car is directly in front of the truck driver, how could he possibly not see this???The most hilarious scene though is when Woody is moving around in the middle of the road and a person in a car honks at him. Woody then ducks in front of the car as it drives over him. 1) Why would you sound your car horn if there was a toy in the road? 2) The driver therefore saw Woody as he sounded his horn. 3) He must have seen Woody moving about and be thrown from the moving van. Does this driver know toys are alive or something? Is it only kids who are unaware? I just don\\'t understand. It\\'s never fully explained. Continuing this point: when the toys all surround Woody and prepare to attack him after he knocks Buzz out the window, we hear Andy from outside shouting. This allows them to return into position. What if he hadn\\'t have shouted though? He would have walked in and seen them. This is why this idea of toys coming to life could never work! No kid would always shout when they enter their room and most kids leave their doors open yet Andy never does - allowing the toys to move around and communicate.Once you take these plot holes into account, the conclusion is that the film sucks and is a really poor movie. Honestly how could anyone like it? An interesting idea that just falls flat. And also the final question that is never addressed is: Why can\\'t toys reveal they\\'re alive to humans??? It\\'s never explained and I don\\'t get why. Poor film 1 star. Awful.',\n",
       "  \"Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library.\",\n",
       "  'Just in case you were also wondering what happened to all the toys that went missing when you were a kid, the answer is clear: They escaped.\"Toy Story\" is the kind of children\\'s movie adults can enjoy just as much, because it very cleverly mines deep deposits of nostalgia from the memory banks. That may be the reason the 1990s bedroom of young Andy is populated by playthings of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. If Andy was a real boy of his time, there would be a computer and a TV/Nintendo, and not much else.The voicings of the various toys add to the enjoyability. Tom Hanks was the biggest star of the moment when \"Toy Story\" came out, and he works with that likeability by creating a stable center as Woody the cowboy doll. Don Rickles has the screen role of his career (not that \"Kelly\\'s Heroes\" was Oscar material) as a prickly Mr. Potato Head, while Jim Varney and R. Lee Ermey are standouts in the supporting cast.Tim Allen gives the movie\\'s best performance, as a newfangled toy that takes Woody\\'s place in Andy\\'s heart but can\\'t bring himself to accept that he\\'s just a plastic plaything. It\\'s the role of the story that gives him the best lines (\"I don\\'t believe that man has ever been to medical school\"), but Allen delivers them with real panache. He more than holds his own, and you kind of see where he took off with that note-perfect William Shatner parody he perfected on screen in the underrated \"Galaxy Quest.\"While this movie\\'s use of computer animation makes it a milestone, it neither represents the most innovative use of the technology or the cleverest Pixar-ated treatment of a story. \"A Bug\\'s Life\" seems a more worthy apex; that story was funnier, worked better on its own merits, and used the animation to better effect. But given how novel all of this was in 1995, \"Toy Story\" could have been a lot less thought-through than it was, and still made gobs of money. The fact it is instead invested with real heart, and can be watched and enjoyed today just as easily as when it debuted nearly 10 years ago, is a tribute to the people behind it.I like Randy Newman\\'s music, just not here, and while the animation textures are surprisingly lifelike, there are places, especially with Scud the dog but also with the baby\\'s drool, where it falls short. The story itself gets kind of rote with repeat viewings, though the transition to Sid\\'s bedroom and its sad mutilated toys is a genius moment. So too are the vending machine aliens, who gape in rapt wonder at the judgment of \"the claw.\" If it reached for pathos a little less often, \"Toy Story\" would be an undeniable classic.As it is, it is very, very good, the kind of film that\\'s only good for children, even (especially?) the inner ones.',\n",
       "  \"Toy Story â€“ 5/5 starsChildren play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc\\x85 But what if toys were real? What if they could talk?Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks).Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely.'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities.What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever.Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good.The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy).The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made â€“ something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.''Toy Story' 1 & 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films â€“ not sequels â€“ by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway.\",\n",
       "  'Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.',\n",
       "  'Y\\'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn\\'t looking! In Andy\\'s Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there\\'s a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and \"plastic corrosion awareness meetings,\" until Andy\\'s birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops \"in the field\" (downstairs watching Andy\\'s gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels \\x96 in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature \\x96 just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the \"real people\") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The \"Disney Movie\" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney\\'s tyrannical umbrella overarches this film\\'s production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney\\'s craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar\\'s first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are \"messages,\" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz\\'s greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz\\'s escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, \"Clearly I will go sailing no more,\" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy\\'s family was Pixar\\'s triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney\\'s *idÃ©e fixe* of the 1950\\'s nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz \\x96 who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy\\'s favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of \"playing inert\" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it\\'s instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz\\'s ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as \"Mrs. Nesbitt\"). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, \"This is not flying - this is falling with style,\" simply seals this movie\\'s greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master\\'s infallible toy filing system\\x85.',\n",

Only to start, the story: The toys have life of their own, and every time we humans are distant from them, they have their lives and their own plans.

Even if merchandising hadn\\'t been released to support the film, all the supporting cast could already by bought in your local toy shop.  I\\'m sure I wasn\\'t the only viewer who found this more than a little suspect.[Possible spoiler:]The second, perhaps larger, point against the film lies in the characterisation of the two boys, Andy and Sid.  Andy is the \"good\" boy. He plays safely and passively with his toys, they don\\'t do anything toys wouldn\\'t do.  Sid, the \"bad\" boy is more creative.  He adapts toys to fit his own vision, he\\'s an innovator, a creator.  It\\'s this very creativity of his that is portrayed as a bad thing.

MORE of the same!!! More of revolutionary film-making, more of grandiose new ideas, more of never-before-seen special effects, more of 150 minutes without relapsing, more of the James Cameron genius...I am very happy that the trailers didn\\'t give the full story away. Lots of emotions are waiting for the viewer, laughter and tears also. Cameron was very smart keeping the teasers as teasers, nothing more... as the full movie will take your breath away.You will practically not notice that you are watching a non-existing world, it is sooo real. Attention to detail is superb. You computer geeks will know what I am talking about. This move was not rushed in the making. No wonder it could not have been done before - not having the proper computing power.The wild life, the jungle, the animals, the Na\\'vi-s, or the dragon-like flying creatures are all so life-like, they almost pop-off the screen (and in 3D they actually do :) .The sound effects were so well done, that when I saw at the credits that Skywalker Sound was behind it, i could only think of \"yessss... now THAT makes sense.\"Cameron is a visionaire - and again, he delivers, with full blast.A certain character says in the movie that Pandora (the planet where the story takes place) became his real world. My advice to you: let Pandora become YOUR real world for two and a half hours, let it make you completely forget about your life and problems, let it entertain you, move you, let it carry you away.Because THAT is what i expect as an exchange for my ticket.And a few hours ago i got tens of tickets worth of that.',\n",

What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler's List. His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on.Avatar is the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, who replaces his brother on a secret mission to infiltrate the Na' vi, the colony of beings that sit on the planet of Pandora, where there is a precious ore, that sells at a ridiculous amount. When Jake learns the ways of the Na' vi, his feelings and learnings will put him and the people he trusts in dangerous jeopardy.The performances here, in the sense of reacting, becoming, and understanding what Cameron has written are astounding. Not to be confused with a sensational bravura performance from some of the centuries best such as Marion Brando, Tom Hanks, or Diane Keaton; these actors along with the director inhabit these visual transformations with special effects as if they are have lived these beings all their lives. This is all based on character movements and reactions. Sam Worthington, as Jake Sully, is an actor who's on his way to becoming a star. Though he has problems with his Aussie accent often enough in the film, he gets the job done. Zoe Saldana, who plays Neytiri, a Na' vi huntress, is thrilling and electrifying. Stephen Lang, as the rock hard Colonel Miles, takes on a villainous turn to a new level in science fiction. He offers actual emotion and emotes evil to the audience and gains our hatred easily. Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Dr. Grace, is sufficient enough to have on screen again teamed with Cameron. She lives inside her role with effortless ease, but suffers from some of the typical James Cameron cheesy lines.Narratively the film works perfectly on the cinematic level. The first forty minutes or so require patience and hope as it is the weakest part of the film and offers some dreariness, but when the second act takes off, it's sky high with no limits for James Cameron. Avatar delivers the best action sequences put on film of all time. That is the boldest statement I have ever made in all my years of criticism. I sat on this for two days before charging it out, but I mean it. It is the best visual experience of my life, period.Other than those visuals, the film pops with all the other technical aspects thrown into one. Art Direction is killer as the two worlds blend in perfectly for an acceptable time. The Film Editing is the crowning achievement of the film as it also offers the perfect blend of the two worlds, enticing the viewer and shifting us around. Mauro Fiore is the threat for a Cinematography Oscar this year. It was if the viewer sat down in a chair, put on glasses, and was literally placed on Pandora, spaceships, and floating mountains. The viewer can feel so engulfed by the imagery, you feel like you can smell the leaves from the trees. Avatar is utterly hypnotizing. James Horner's score is some of the best work done in his career. It offers a variable of devastation that moves the viewer to near tears. It goes back to his work on Titanic, where the musical instruments lifted the material immensely. The entire sound team is also locked and loaded for Oscar recognition as the feeling of animals, machines, and arrows buzzing by your head leave you imprisoned in Cameron's exquisite film.James Cameron has come back home ladies and gentlemen Cameron is back, bigger, badder, and mature in his crowning work of his career. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic do not even compare anymore. This is the film that can blend the fans of those two films together and lock Cameron into your heart. He's a definite spoiler for a directing bid for the Academy Awards. You have admire the raw, natural talent the man has. How could you ever conceive such an experience and put that much effort and work into it and have it pay off? The box office success will surely keep him in the minds of voters for various critics' awards. His screenplay, leaps and bounds better than 1997's Best Picture Winner, is primed, developed and ripe for the taking. Though, you do acquire the tacky and atypical dialogue you expect from a science fiction director of this caliber, you can appreciate the effort and the honesty of it all. James Cameron is everything Michael Bay wishes he was, to put it bluntly.Avatar will bring also great actors putting their best foot forward such as Giovanni Ribisi, who is as underrated as they come. Michelle Rodriguez who exudes sexy like any woman starring in a sci-fi epic. Joel Moore, showing his range outside of his comedic work in Dodgeball: An Underdog Story. And the classy veteran actors, CCH Pounder and Wes Studi, who just simply don't work enough.Avatar is one of the best films of the year. The most exciting, thrilling, and superb work you'll feast your eyes on in any theater this century. Cinema, forever, will remember the benchmark that James Cameron placed not only for himself, but for any man, daring to change the game, the way Cameron did. Avatar is a movie experience to be remembered, and please experience in a movie theater first.***Â½/****\",\n",
       "  'I had the rather intense privilege to view James Cameron\\'s much anticipated $400 million budget return to the directing scene, Avatar, at the Empire Leicester Square in London.Where to begin! The visuals in this pieces was groundbreaking. He did it with the Terminator series and then Titanic, so one would expect Cameron to deliver... and HE DID! The visual are by far some of the sharpest CGI I have seen. You could almost say that there is a disquiet that follows Cameron\\'s soul, as there is no other possibility of this strong and intensified quality. Its production design and visual effects are both noteworthy and it will get its praise upon official release.What it was lacking that really should have shaped the movie is its character/story. I was expecting a complex and believable plot, but was left with a movie with mostly strong visuals. What most sci-fi lovers desire is mind-bending philosophies, fantasy and exploration and limitations of our or outer species. If it was not for this factor, I would give this a 9.5 vote.Avatar will be a success, not only because of Cameron\\'s legacy, but by very intelligent and viral marketing. Avatar have had a powerful marketing technique that assembles other successful blockbusters, such as The Blair Witch project (you all remember it), The Dark Knight (Joker invades the world) and also, the current production The Artifice (the-artifice.com) that is intelligently targeting the market.Kudos to Cameron, Avatar is one of the (if not The) movie of the year. I could get in trouble for sharing this with you guys so early, so please click Yes on \"Was the above comment useful to you?\" as a thank you. ;)',\n",
       "  \"It has been 12 years since Cameron unleashed the phenomenon that was Titanic and real fans would have to look as far back as 1991's Terminator 2 for their last proper dose of his incredibly epic action (True Lies, while fun, really doesn't count). So the anticipation for Avatar has long since reached fever pitch and beyond.Thankfully for the patient masses, Avatar has turned out to be the biggest and best event movie of the year, perhaps the decade. The story is pure Cameron simplicity â€“ a paraplegic ex-marine is given a chance to walk again through the use of a unique alien body, called an Avatar. It is his job to gain the trust of the natives so that a greedy corporation can steal the precious metal from their lush moon. Jake's (Sam Worthington) crippled main character is the perfect point of contact for the audience â€“ not only is he new to the visual delights of Pandora but his disability means that every moment in his Avatar body is one of glorious freedom from the confinement of his chair. When the Corporations intentions become more sinister, Jake must choose between his new found place with the natives and his own race and fight for what he believes in.Avatar combines parts of Pocahontas and Braveheart with a liberal dose of Space Marines into an epic whole that takes nearly three full hours to unfold. We could criticise that length, the weak story and the hammy dialogue. We could attack its thinly-veiled ecological message or the frankly bizarre spirituality in its second half but honestly nothing can spoil the experience while you are enveloped in it. And a large part of that is down to the brilliant use of 3D â€“ which is both subtle and incredibly effective. Til now, we have been making movies with 3D elements, Avatar is the first truly 3D film and might well prove to be one of the most significant things to happen to blockbuster film-making since Star Wars.Cameron is also pushing the envelope with truly photo-real CG â€“ something which has been promised for years but has finally been delivered with Avatar. The interactions of the characters with the environment is incredible and the detail on the faces of the motion-captured leads (Worthington and Star Trek's Zoe Saldana) bring them to life. You will believe totally in their performances, representing another quantum leap in tools which have rarely been used for anything other than spectacle.Make no mistake, Avatar is an important film from a technical standpoint but it is also great entertainment. The world of Pandora is a stunning spectacle from scene to scene and as Jake learns more about the Na'vi the film approaches the kind of light hearted adventure story which has been absent from movie theatres for years. Then the final act explodes into tragedy and desperate action, with the final half hour a blistering life or death struggle that has to be seen to be disbelieved.Over the coming days you will be hearing a lot about Avatar, and some of the critical reaction is bound to focus on its weaknesses in a bid to appear appropriately reserved and objective. But this is not a film to be dissected or examined, rather one to be experienced with a warm crowd, a great sound system, in 3D as you bask in the knowledge that the movie-making master is back!\",\n",
       "  \"It was Terminator in the 1980's and then Titanic in the '90s and it's definitely Avatar in the 2000s!!James Cameron is my most favourite director and he has once again broken all boundaries and created a visual extravaganza.Avatar is Cameron's latest magnum opus is probably one of the most anticipated movies since Titanic and now it seems that the visionary director has indeed created a film that'll revolutionise the world of cinema.The movie is set in the year 2154 and is about a man called Jake who can't walk and he is selected in the Avatar program where he has to go to Pandora jungle which is not a planet but it is one of the three giant gasses that is about 4 light years away from earth. On Pandora there are life forms such as the navis that are about 10 feet tall have sparkly blue skin, big eyes and tails. The humans have genetically bred human-navi hybrids known as Avatars. Jake is able to walk but falls in love with a female navi and now he has to choose the side between humans or the navis.The film was absolutely fascinating, interesting, entertaining and emotional. I loved the look on the Pandora jungle and it must be the best scenery in film history and the navis are definitely the best digital characters since Gollum from The Lord of the Rings. The special effects are so amazing that Pandora looks like a real location and you can mistake the navis as real characters. Avatar was almost 3 hours but it didn't seem that long.Avatar already makes it on my top 5 favourite movies and I intend to see it again and I am already waiting for it to release on Blu Ray because I'm sure that it will be one of the best Blu Ray titles.\",\n",
       "  'I was not blown away by this movie like everyone else seems to be. First, the good stuff. There are some good actors in here, especially the actor who plays Jake (though I might be biased, because he was pretty hot), and they all commit to what they\\'re doing and make it believable. As everyone says, the graphics and visuals are pretty freakin\\' awesome (as well they should be, with the budget of this movie). The world that Cameron creates is stunning, mesmerizing, and pure: the special effects are amazing. Like many, I saw it in 3D and it was good old fashioned movie-going fun. Yay! Okay, now for the not so good parts. As others have stated, the storyline/plot is a little lacking. I had trouble understanding the motivations of many of the characters. Ah, yes, character development - that would have been nice, too. Don\\'t expect any. Yes, it\\'s a recycled and re-used plot: clichÃ©d and often predictable. It seems reminiscent of many great classics, my favorite being \"Star Wars.\" Now I\\'ll be the first to admit that the mythical structure of \"Star Wars\" was not completely original, but at least it seemed Lucas \"made it his own\" (to quote American Idol?) with his original characters and unique setting. \"Avatar\" is practically plagiarism (one line in particular made me want to shout \"THE FORCE!\" in the middle of the movie). Also- we get practically no character background at all, so we have no idea what makes these people tick (perhaps there would have been more if the edited version wasn\\'t already a staggering 2 hrs 40 min.). Instead, we get one-dimensional, stock characters that had me rolling my eyes underneath my uncomfortable and overpriced 3D glasses. Lastly, the film is doused with lessons in morality from Mr. Cameron; it is a blatant criticism of US foreign policy. Not everyone will pick up on this, which I understand, since most of us want mindless entertainment at the movies. But upon closer review, I don\\'t see how some people cannot see it. One of the \"evil\" characters actually says: \"We\\'ll fight terror with terror!\" (Though mind you, they are attacking a planet filled with peaceful inhabitants who have never attacked them, for the simple quest of obtaining a precious metal called...unobtainium...::rolls eyes again::) Now I don\\'t mind a little political satire here and there, but it seems misplaced in what is seemingly intended as a mindlessly entertaining popcorn flick.To give an example of the poor story-telling and lack of motivation: the \"evil\" humans are attacking the peaceful planet of Pandora in hopes of getting more \"unobtainium\" (gah it\\'s so cheesy) but Cameron never bothers to tell us WHY. It is barely even mentioned. Is it just pretty and shiny like gold? Or, as another reviewer brilliantly pointed out, this stuff could save lives on Earth for all we know. It is never explained and the movie makers just assume you will accept it and not care what the reason is. I was actually really glad to come to IMDb and find there were others who felt the same way. I don\\'t think it was an awful movie, I just don\\'t think it\\'s worthy of the enormous praise that seems to surround it. Should you see it? Yeah, sure, it\\'s pretty entertaining I guess. And if you are into graphics/special effects, and/or don\\'t mind gaping plot holes, then you\\'ll probably love it.Bottom line: Remember when Lucas revamped the \"Star Wars\" saga with the three new prequels, and instead of telling a great story with interesting characters like he did with the original trilogy, he got so obsessed with graphics and special effects that it pretty much ruined the whole movie? Yeah, it\\'s kind of like that. I guess they stole that from \"Star Wars,\" too.',\n",
       "  'I am sure my comment will be lost in a sea of blue but anyways here goes...Just attended the Advanced Screening at my local \"Event Cinema\" BCC in 3DNow this movies graphics are gorgeous, everything is so real, the 3D just adds to the effect beautifully without distracting you.From a technical standpoint this movie is amazing, just the detail on the Navi\\'s faces are amazing, they feel more real then their real life counterparts!Without giving anything away about the story, the plot itself is very solid, very character driven and perfectly executed by Jim, safe to say this is his best original story since \"The Terminator\" and \"Terminator 2\" and is definitely one of his best movies, so good it ties with T2 which is my most favorite movie of all time...So for those of you who have not seen this yet... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!5/5',\n",
       "  \"A film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today's economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually, aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves.Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na'vi, Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.That's not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clichÃ©d and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clichÃ©d despite being between man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future.9.5/10\",\n",
       "  'I actually enjoyed this quite a bit, but I am giving it a 1, because I cannot believe that it deserves an 8.8, which is what it is getting this evening, mostly apparently due to suspicious ratings from countries like Slovakia, India and Australia. Not that I have anything against those countries, it just strikes me as odd that so few good reviews are coming from the United States. I\\'m not saying that IMDb\\'s ratings are being manipulated by some sort of conspiracy, I am just saying it is odd. Anyways, rather than try and balance my review with what was good (the visuals, the 3D, the sound effects), am just going to say what really sucked. Can I say \"sucked\" in my review? Guess I will find out.1. \"Unobtainium.\" Really, \"unobtainium?\" Was this a kid\\'s cartoon? 2. Sigourney Weaver\\'s confused and cartoonish scientist character. She\\'s tough, she smokes, she has a heart of gold, and her Avatar dresses like Dora the Explorer. Also, why try and make her look twenty years younger than she is? I can\\'t tell if they used CGI, Botox, or a ton of make-up, but she looked like the female version of the Picture of Dorian Gray. What a waste of talent.3. Hundres of years in the future, they can create magical avatar clones and transmit brain signals to them, but they still use flimsy wheelchair thingies? 4. Less than a half dozen animals on Pandora, and all but the floating jellyfish are angry and violent. Really? No fish? No birdies? No toads, snails, foxes, puppy dogs, kitty cats, mosquitoes, or anything but those half dozen CGI creature types? Seems like Pandora was populated by a relatively cheap CGI outfit.5. The trees all communicate through synapses, and this is supposed to be ominous, yet this never turns into anything compelling. Did Jimmy Cameron get tired of his own idea? Or was it to hrd to animate something more interesting? 6. Almost half a billion dollars to make this?!?!?!?!? 7. \"Unobtainium?\" \"Unobtainium?????\" 8. Cartoony tough military guy who does not have a clue how to organize a military campaign.9. The Na\\'Vi speak broken English that somehow becomes perfect English on and off throughout the movie. And the Avatars speak perfect English in normal tone of voice, identical to their human voices, although their bone structure is completely non-human?!?!?!? 10. Unobtainium I could go on and on, but you get the picture. This was like an extremely expensive and pretty kiddie cartoon. What a waste, and absolutely NOT deserving of the rating it is getting here.',\n",
       "  'Let me preface this by saying I am a huge James Cameron fan. I think \"Terminator\" is a masterpiece of sci-fi and the single best edited film of all time, \"Aliens\" is easily the best sequel not from the original director and I personally like it a lot more than the original. \"Abyss\" created an interesting world and was racked with tension, \"Terminator 2\" is an action tour-de-force and has what I believe the best sound editing/design of all time, \"True Lies\" is goofy fun, more poignant than most give it credit for with a boffo ending, and finally \"Titanic\" was far better than anyone expected it to be and has one of the most believable romances in a movie.So then there was the 12 year wait for \"Avatar\". No reviews, word of mouth, ticket price or natural disaster would keep me from the midnight IMAX 3D screening. I went with moderate expectations, which the film matched exactly. While this kept me from being disappointed it wasn\\'t a good thing.Movie fans were on edge because if \"Avatar\" flops, it\\'ll mean the death of creativity in a remake-happy Hollywood. That\\'s a valid concern but the problem is nothing in \"Avatar\" is creative whatsoever. It is literally \"Dances with Wolves\" in space, right down to having a \"Wind in his Hair\" character as a foil to the \"new guy\".As the movie progressed it caused the worst of all bad reactions for me as a viewer - I started thinking about other things. Then I kept thinking \"well the end battle is supposed to be awesome\".SPOILER WARNING! (if for some reason you can\\'t guess how this movie ends) End battle comes and the movie switches from being \"Dances with Wolves\" to Disney\\'s \"Atlantis\" (but that\\'s unfair since both of those movies contained far, FAR better musical scores) Gunship windows that were impervious to arrows a few scenes ago (to show Na\\'vi desperation) suddenly become brittle and break easily (to show Na\\'vi heroism). The battle isn\\'t nearly as long as you\\'d expect, and nowhere near as epic / engaging as the finale of Return of the King. Finally there\\'s a Robo-suit vs Navi fight and it is admittedly pretty good. Unlike 95% of directors these days Cameron knows enough to pull the camera back and let us SEE the fight. However it\\'s an odd choice to spend millions on 10 foot tall \"creatures\" and then rarely even have them in the same frame as humans.And of course there\\'s the obligatory scene where characters are dying in slow motion as Middle Eastern vocal music plays (see Gladiator or Munich) Wouldn\\'t have been so bad if I hadn\\'t said to my friend on the way there \"How much you wanna bet there\\'s a part where characters die in slow motion over Middle Eastern music?\"As with most movies these days \"Avatar\" is far too long, glossing over important details (why is Earth dying, what does Unobtainium do, etc) and instead spending time on flight scenes, mystic ceremonies, spirit trees and nature bonding.Ultimately I just did not care. Since the dawn of cinema Hollywood recycles old ideas every few decades and slaps on a bigger budget / new stars / better effects so you won\\'t notice. I can see re-doing \"Ben Hur\" with color and sound, but why do we need \"Dances with Wolves\" with 20 times the budget and blue Native Americans? No amount of impressive visuals, robo-suits, gunship battles, perfect character CGI or Sigorney Weaver can change the fact that I\\'ve seen this movie 100 times before. I could even accept the weak story if there were any characters to give a rat\\'s ass about. This film is also dreadfully humorless, a stark contrast to \"Titanic\" where humor was one of its many surprises.Regarding 3D... I\\'ve seen many films in it now and honestly you don\\'t even notice after the few minutes. It doesn\\'t make the money any better or worse, just more expensive.Citizen Kane, The Robe, Sound of Music, Jaws, Star Wars, Batman, Toy Story, The Matrix... these movies changed movies. We can say that looking back now. \"Avatar\" saying it would ahead of time is pure hubris, \"unsinkable Titanic\"-like poppycock.But if expensive motion-capture being used to cover up a weak, generic story is the future of cinema then count me out, I\\'ll stick with my PS3.',\n",
       "  \"Nobody directs like James Cameron. Ten years in the works, and every minute was worth it. It is the Star Wars of the 21st century. Though the plot is derivative and bears some pretty close resemblance to Dances with Wolves and a little bit of The Last Samurai, it does not ruin a mind-blowing experience. Avatar has a great future ahead of it and, possibly another Oscar for the mighty James Cameron. Jake Sully, is an ex-marine, bound to a wheel chair. He seeks to make a fresh start on the moon Pandora where his brother worked. The moon has a military run mining colony. The business has brought humans into contact with the local natives, tall blue dudes, called Na'vi. The Na'vi inhabit a part of the moon under which lies a large deposit of valuable minerals, and the humans are trying to get them to relocate. Colonel Quarich who runs the operation, ask Sully to go under cover as a Na'vi, to learn the secrets, to give the humans an advantage. If successful, Sully will get his legs back. The magic of future science and 3-D effects give Sully a handsome genetically engineered Avatar body, and he embarks on his mission. Once on the inside however, his loyalties to the humans start to turn when his heart gets lost to the Na'vi princess Neytiri. Is he willing to fight on the blue side now?The landscape of Pandora is the most creative and inventive of the decade. There are creatures that you might find in your wildest dreams or your worst nightmares. There is flora and fauna that shine with the bioluminescence of a thousand deep sea critters, and also trees which dwarf the Empire State Building.I guess the only noticeable problem with Avatar, is a lack of original story. What you see on the screen will blow you away, but all the tough critics, may come down a bit on the fact that despite being the latest in film technology, Cameron uses a very old archetypal formula, perhaps just a bit too schematic. There are a few badly scripted segments of dialogue, but nothing that makes you wanna blow raspberries at the screen.What is most important is the fact that Cameron's story gets the viewer involved and offers a handful of memorable and likable characters to root for, and some to root against. This is the post- modern era, and originality is rare, but if there is any technical progress to be made in the world of movies and entertainment, there is one name that dwarfs all JAMES CAMERON, and after ten years hiding from the Hollywood mainstream, he is back.\",\n",
       "  'AVATAR has a soul I saw AVATAR today. It was a boiling 40 degrees Celsius in Australia. I caught a bus and train to get there. I spent months on a forum before that. Incremental stops included a scriptment, stills, a teaser, a foot, AVATAR day and a full trailer. Now released I have had many reviews to read which have been mostly very positive. It is a marvel to watch. The opening scenes are very sci-fi with a glimpse of low gravity aboard a space-craft. Sam Worthington fills us in with a short narration. He is taking over his diseased brother\\'s role in the AVATAR program. These opening scenes are actually among the most effective 3D in the film, pulling you into this story, tracking shots putting you into the steps of the characters. I jump ahead, like the film, to The world of Pandora which is lush with earthly life as seen through pulp fantasies. The rendering of this world is terrific. The life and activity is in the plants as much as it is the animals. Wonder is generated with this ambitious creation. Cameron has lifted the bar. The CG is the best I have ever seen. Everything you have heard is true. The 3D enhances this with leaves falling and swaying branches life-like in the foreground. The realisation of the Navii is also ambitious. They are CG but there are many moments that make you think they are real and in terms of the story they are more than good enough to propel the narrative with strong emotional content. I went into this film knowing mostly everything within it. Hours of reading, some from the treatment and pages of the recent reviews. It is very much a family film like \"Nealz\" said in his IMDb review. There is a moment where one of the ferocious animal species that earlier were attacking Jake are seen with a litter, the children in the audience loved the cute pups! The spiritual side of this film is much better than expected. It is in fact a beautiful story. The structure is classical film-making but with amazingly new scope in CGI to express grand images. An epic The journey that Jake takes through Pandora is lovely. He is taken in by the Navii and explores their culture, language and habitat. Natirii, the female Navii he meets while lost, helps him through this journey. This is a love story of both soul mates and with a wider picture. Existential connections with the natural world. Personal destiny. I had tears in this film. I tried to hold them back but by the roll of credits they came. This is a movie that I have anticipated for so long. I think the ingredients of its story and my connection to this films production gave me a very emotional response. I cant imagine this disappointing any of the fans on the board. Keeping in mind that it is a family film but delivered everything I wanted. Expect a special edition. After AVATAR is a hit, a special edition will make its way to the cinema. I can understand why they would cut the earth scenes and it works. The actual film seems pretty brisk and it could also have more padding out. You want more of it and that is a triumph for this type of film running two and a half hours. It is a good balance because at two and a half hours AVATAR is aimed directly at the cinema going audience. Broadly appealing with elements for everyone. My earlier prediction of a billion or more world-wide seems safe. I don\\'t want to go on about visuals too much but the lovely shots of the natural wonderland of glowing life in still 3D shots is magical. Something to take kids to see. Floating tiny neon life jellyfish their way through the air with grace. The monkey-like extra-limbed creatures with the peeping eyes flock through the forrest quickly. The creature design is done in a clever way with the motion of a living thing. The action is over the top, epic, frenetic and a new take on the battle sequence. James Cameron didn\\'t stuff this up. He probably pressed the studio way beyond their comfort zone with the time, money and effort that has gone into this. Sam Worthington is excellent casting choice. Sigourney Weaver ads frank reason. Stephen Lang chews the scenery as the ultimate you know what. Zoe Saldana is beautiful as Jakes guide into this world and. I went to the cinema and it was a very hot day. By the time I left the cinema, the streets were wet with rain. A warm humidity was thick in the air. Lightning splashed my walk to the train station with white light. I honestly wondered if It was my time to be struck down with a bolt of electricity from the sky. Watch this film. It is destined to become a childhood classic to many little-ones too young to be on this forum. It will be talked about at high school by male and females as spectacular. It will be watched multiple times by fans. I loved it but beyond my appreciation for the film itself, is the the message of love permeating from this movie that I hope enters the zeitgeist like elements of Cameron\\'s other stories have. At its heart is a soul. AVATAR is an achievement in many technical departments but I wouldn\\'t say the story is deficient. It is a beautiful experience and the story is surprisingly what I loved most. Believe the hype.',\n",
       "  'I have never been so close to leave the movie theater, as i was when seeing Avatar. Sure, it\\'s very beautiful to look at, but, if you\\'ve seen the trailer, then you\\'ve seen the movie! It\\'s basically every movie clichÃ©s put together in one horrible and so unoriginal movie. it\\'s a mix of the \"last samurai\" meets \"Pocahontas\" meets \"Atlantis\"! it\\'s by far the most horrible storyline since Ed Woods\\' \"plan 9 from outer space\".Not once are you surprised by the turn of events in this movie, and there\\'s so many bad movie clichÃ©s in it, and so many things that just doesn\\'t make any sense at all (even in their universe). for example, the last fight scene with the giant robot and the Avatar. It really doesn\\'t make any sense at all, that the robot is carrying a 8-foot-1 hunting knife, just in case he loses his gun (which could easily have been attach to the robot!), and that the robot tells the avatar, what he\\'s about to do, instead of just doing it (A good example of a bad clichÃ©).If you want to see this movie, i recommend you either see the trailer ( as that is enough for you, to litterily, call every scene in the movie) or you go out and buy Atlantis and just Imagine it with smurfs instead of underwater people.',\n",
       "  \"I realize I am probably going to get flames galore for this comment, and you all have the right to your opinion about my opinion, but hey, I'm entitled to my opinion too. Avatar is grade A crap. That's right, it's crap. I say this for one simple reason: Without the special effects this movie would never, ever captivate and take a hold of audiences like it has in the past week. Ask yourself this one question: If it didn't have the effects, the Navi plugging their hair into the trees like it's a damn broadband jack, mech suits(just like the ones in Matrix Revolutions) and barely futuristic ospreys, would you care about this movie at all? It's a truism when they say this movie is nothing more than Dances with Wolves in space. Some people may argue back that Star Wars borrowed from Hidden fortress, but at least it had enough compelling plot points to make it look different, such as I don't know... the force? The Death Star? Outer space? A location that has NOTHING at all to do with Earth? This important set of points clearly differentiates Star Wars and Hidden Fortress. But The difference between Avatar and Dances with wolves is... CGI. This CGI may be pretty but it cannot ever substitute for story and plot development. Speaking of, the characters save but a few are either very bland or stereotypes. The worst part is the story and the movie gives us no reason to care about the characters. You know what? I'll go one step further and say that the only difference between Avatar and a Star Wars prequel is this: Avatar has an environmental story that we can relate to. That's it. True, the action scenes in Avatar are well done, but hell, the action scenes in the Star Wars prequels were also arguably well-done. Still, there's that nagging lack of story development. Avatar is a huge let-down and doesn't belong on the best-of list of anybody with common sense.\",\n",
       "  'At the risk of repeating what countless others have said, this movie is blatant plagiarism. If a film student submitted the Avatar screenplay to an instructor, he/she would have been given an F. Colleges expel students for less obvious ripoffs than this. If you\\'ve watched Pocahontas or Dances With Wolves, you know the drill. The only difference is the ending, which has the pretty blue humanoids escorting humans to their Earth-bound ships at gunpoint, which I freely admit is a rather neat sight since my ancestors were American Indian, Irish, and Scot. As a result, I am perhaps overly sensitive to the plight of a civilization driven from their homeland and/or oppressed by a conquering nation - er, planet.However, originality is not James Cameron\\'s strong suit, so my disappointment is directed more at WETA. Yes, my beloved WETA, who impressed me throughout the years but completely stole my heart after the masterful rendering of all things Tolkien in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I had two reasons for seeing this film. One was a 13-year-old boy, the other was my anticipation over what wonders WETA would lay at my feet.Now, had the budget not been nearly half a billion dollars, I\\'d have understood the cartoonish creations, but as it stands there\\'s no good reason for the results. Viewers are praising this film as revolutionary. I call \"horsesh!t\". This was nowhere near the caliber of WETA\\'s LOTR work, their King Kong work, or their X-Men work. In fact, it wasn\\'t even up to snuff with their Narnia production. The quantity of work was greater, not the quality.I\\'ve never reviewed a film in my life. I actually registered here for the sole purpose of expressing my resentment at having wasted $20 bucks and 3 hours on such nonsense. Booooooo.',\n",
       "  'The King of the World has returned! Mr. James Cameron\\'s youngest \"Avatar\" is a mind-blowing adventure and the most impressive and intricate work of art, I\\'ve ever seen.When his twin brother is killed, disabled ex-Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is recruited to aid a mining expedition on the distant jungle moon of Pandora as only his DNA will bond with the alien hybrid body, known as an Avatar, that allows humans to breathe the toxic air. With orders to infiltrate the Na\\'vi, Jake finds himself falling in love with native girl, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).\"Avatar\\'\" was created twelve years ago by Cameron, but was ahead of its time. Cameron had to shelve the project and wait for technology to catch up to the script he had written. In 2005 Cameron thought he was close enough to push the technology to tell the story he always wanted to tell and went back to work. It cost Jim blood, sweat and tears and of course a lot of money, but the result is just fascinating, mesmerizing. Money well spent.I am really happy that the movie turned out great. Not just for Jim\\'s sake or because it had been a while since I\\'d seen a really good movie, but because of all the \"Avatar\" haters out there. All of those people who were trashing the movie before even watching it. They didn\\'t give the movie a chance and let everyone believe that the movie was going to be really bad.Well, they were all wrong and I hope they are honest enough to admit that. OK, maybe the love story wasn\\'t really original, but it worked. However, if the story doesn\\'t work for you, everything else will make up for it. When you watch the movie in 3D it becomes a transcendent and amazing experience that\\'s the closest you will ever come to setting foot on a strange new world. The length of the movie is 2 hours and 41 minutes, but it looked a lot shorter. I wanted more. I just didn\\'t want it to stop. It was that good.I advise them and everyone to give the movie a chance and watch it the way it was mend to be watched, in 3D. You won\\'t regret it!Oh yeah, I almost forgot. When you\\'re watching the movie, it\\'s completely normal to be attracted to Neytiri \\x85 Right? Heck even Jim says he\\'s attracted to the Na\\'vi creatures!',\n",
       "  '\"Avatar\" is not the next \"Star Wars\" or \"Lord of the Rings.\" It might be the next \"Matrix,\" though. Or, perhaps more accurate, the next \"Matrix Revolutions.\" It\\'s technically groundbreaking craftmanship put to work on a story that was played out after \"Return of the King.\" There are a lot of bad guys, a lot of good guys, and sooner or later they\\'re all gonna meet on the battlefield. The little details are not-so-shockingly unimportant, since nothing could stop, change or even, really, comment on the unstoppable trajectory of this film\\'s story.It\\'s the future. An Evil Corporation is parked on distant planet Pandora, mining the planet of all its precious minerals. The native population, big blue humanoids called the \"Na\\'vi,\" aren\\'t too happy about this. The corporation has hired scientists to create avatars of Na\\'vi bodies to be controlled by human brains, in order to communicate to the Na\\'vi that...they better move, lest be bulldozed by the evil Col. Qautrich (Stephen Lang).Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is flown in to Pandora because his twin brother, who had an Avatar made specifically for him, is dead. The coincidence is an obvious plot device so that we can have a newcomer to Pandora to share in our amazement. Oh, and he\\'s paralyzed, so running around in his new alien body is rather freeing for him.I don\\'t feel as if I need to continue with the plot description. You know what\\'ll happen. You\\'ve seen \"Dances with Wolves\" and \"The Last Samurai.\" Heck, even \"Dead Man.\" The Na\\'vi represent nature, the (all-American) corporation represents destructive technology. Quatrich has a Southern accent and says things like, \"we have to fight terror with terror.\" The Na\\'vi are clones of Native Americans - filtered through the imagination of a white liberal. It\\'s all very obvious.The question, of course, is whether or not it\\'s entertaining. Well...sometimes. It certainly looks good. Some sequences - especially those with the winged beasts - are eye-popping. Lang makes a fun villain. Pandora is more derivative than original, it reminded me most of Skull Island in Peter Jackson\\'s King Kong. All the monsters have a plastic-y look to them that make them feel too well-done. The 3D is distracting at times and I had a headache before the movie was over.But there are scenes and individual shots that pop with ethereal beauty. It\\'s worth seeing for that reason, but I don\\'t think it\\'ll be as fun after multiple viewings. The great thing about \"Star Wars\" was the characters: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and so on. They embodied the other-worldliness of the story, taking the weight off the effects.In thirty-two years, I don\\'t think anyone will remember \"Jake Sully.\" 6/10',\n",
       "  \"First I didn't want to go watch Avatar because when I heard Cameron took 3 weeks to write the plot I said to myself there is no hope for cinema anymore. And somehow people are showing me that I was right. I went to watch this piece of .... because I have been told it s unbelievable.Storywise, there is no story at all. It's the typical good vs bad scenario shaped out of cowboys against indians in space mixing it with a yogi everything connects us to the world impression plus a goddamn planet called Pandora and looks like f...in' paradise. Lot's of shiny colours and huge monsters who eat flesh are your best friends. Come on. You gotta be kidding me.Maybe I might be the only one here, cause all reviews I've seen got great score, but that is not what a movie is supposed to be. I was very unimpressed by the CGI and the artistic development because I might be used to computer games such as Final Fantasy series which has been the shaper of such incredible stories, only that these games have a very strong story to tell and and you feel totally involved.It impresses me that people give this such a high rating because of it's visuals. I mean it was clear that sooner or later a movie would appear with such incredible CGI. If it wouldn't have been Avatar another would have been the winner.I am sad that nowadays cinema is ail centered only about violence, good looks and a huge lack of brain.3 out of ten only for the cgi which I thought is not the center of a movie otherwise I would have rated it beneath 0.\",\n",
       "  'This film has nothing worthy of the box office receipts is has garnered. Any third grader can predict the outcome after the first ten minutes. The plot, characters, and themes are either one dimensional or blatant rip offs of earlier tales. Even those parts of the movie that are rehashing some of the great movies of history are delivered without any depth or structure. Consider the poorly constructed moral and it can be seen that it could have been stolen from \"Dances with Wolves\" and others before it, but taken without the bones to support it.Special effects were interesting, but again lacking in any thought to character development. Creatures of this other world were clearly developed in an attempt to make them look \"cool\" without any thought to the evolutionary challenges that may have helped to shape them.It is possible that there is an intended message relating to the tension between science and religion, but it is hardly worth trying to evaluate the directors message. There is so little substance to this movie that the only possible conclusion that one could come to is that the analysis was not worth the effort.',\n",
       "  \"I had high expectations going into Avatar. Now I admit, it's probably stupid to go into any movie with expectations that are too high, lest they be crushed. However, even without high expectations, Avatar impresses only on a technical level, and on that level only. The story is very predictable, and as I watched this movie I was overcome with a feeling as if I had seen this all before in something in a made for TV movie on SyFy. This is pretty bad considering this is the same guy who made The Abyss and Terminator. I can only say that if you go see this movie, expect beautiful visuals... and a standard humdrum story that you've seen before if you follow any number of science fiction TV shows or just sci-fi in general. Oh, and if this is the 22nd century, why are they still using manually propelled wheelchairs?\",\n",
       "  'First of all, let me get it out of the way: yes, Avatar is visually stunning. With better scenario and dialogs, it could have been a very good movie; alas, it was completely predictable, and fancy special effects alone do not make a good movie.Let\\'s start with the picture. As I said before, the special effects and computer animation are really good; the textures feel very real, and the degrees of liberty that CGI animation allows in terms of camera angles and movement is well used for dramatic effects. The luxurious vegetation of the forest and the CGI-animated wild animals are a treat to the eyes. In terms of artwork, there is a definite influence from Nausicaa (the forest-world, the spores) and Starcraft (the vessels, the goliaths). I saw the movie in an IMAX movie with 3D glasses, but I am not convinced that they used the full potential of it - quite honestly, the Haribo commercial before the movie made a better use of it. I find it more strenuous to watch a movie with the 3D-glasses - some details are blurry, and it feels likewise when the camera makes swift lateral movements.Now, the scenario - the movie disappoints in that area. The plot is very Manichean, and it feels like a remake of Pocahontas, interspersed with elements from / tributes to Star Wars (Pandora and the Na\\'vi look like Endor and the Ewoks respectively), Nausicaa (the forest as an entity, the destructive impact of civilization on nature, the spores in the forest), Starcraft (Colonel Quarritch and Dr Augustine bear some resemblance with Arcturus Mensk and Sarah Kerrigan), Matrix (the concept of controlling another image of self), and maybe even Independence Day (the pilot fighter suicide) and the Lion King (the father\\'s death, \"go, and never come back!\", ... am I going to far here?). But I can honestly say that I haven\\'t been surprised at any point in the movie. You know from the beginning that he will be accepted by the Na\\'vi, that he will fall in love, that he will defect, that he will ultimately prevail after suffering some heavy casualties, and that he will find a way to permanently transfer his mind into the body of his avatar.It would have been interesting if the movie had dealt in more depth with the issues related to transferring one\\'s mind into another body for instance, maybe a la Twelve Monkeys Army, where the \"hero\" is clearly deeply affected by experiences that the mind is not used to deal with (time travel in that case, but it is not that different from what we have here). Likewise, the love interest of our hero seems very indifferent to the fact that he really is a human remotely controlling a human - Na\\'vi bastard. I was expecting someone (him, her, or even one of the other humans in the scientific group) to show at least some kind of surprise / doubt when these feelings emerge. I was expecting more complexity in the social interactions of the characters, and their personality.I also take issues with some big stereotypes: corporations and the white men are greedy, indigenous people are pure, brave, and connected to the earth, but dumb - thankfully there is a human to teach them how to fight those who come from the sky. To some extent, the movie feels like a remake of the colonization of the Americas; just replace the Na\\'vis by native Americans, the aircrafts by ships, and modern weapons by muskets, and you have it. Except of course the colonization of the Americas did not have such a happy ending for the native tribes.On the whole, the movie is beautiful, but it feels like the main goal was to showcase fancy special effects. The movie would have benefited from more detailed characters, and a less linear and predictable plot. My rating is 6/10.',\n",
       "  '\"Ok, I get it.\" That\\'s a phrase I found myself saying an awful lot during this 2 1/2 hour computer game that was as painful to the brain as it was to the eyes.First, let\\'s get the obvious out of the way. This film was expensive, in that it cost so much money to make you could solve at least one state\\'s budget crisis with it. So why did it look like it was nearly all conceived on a computer? Not since the \"Star Wars\" prequels has the \"fourth wall\" ever been so demolished. Never once did I care about the characters or believe anything the actors tried to do because I knew it was completely artificial. Hell, people still complain about \"Waterworld\" being overpriced but at least people actually got off their duffs and did some real film shooting! This whole project stinks of imported bottled water and soy lattes. This film is the pinnacle of Hollywood overkill. An overblown, overpriced, overindulgent eyesore of a movie with a \"message.\" Oh yes, the message. Underneath watching the latest in nerd fantasy-fulfillment with its CGI, is a liberal-minded jackhammer drilling into your psyche about the evil of American corporatism, military culture, and rich white men\\'s greed. The noble intent of getting its audience to care about the environment is done in the LSD-esquire rainbow cornucopia of every Native American and African stereotype imaginable, all set to an \"oweyo oweyo\" New Age chorus that makes one actually pine for the sweet sound of the Jonas Brothers. I say this as a die-hard independent who has as much to say about environmental awareness as anyone with a college education, but the caricatures painted here border on MSNBC-levels of leftist philosophy. The bad guys are the Republican racist military and corporate oppressors, who refer to our heroes as \"tree huggers\" and the alien Navi as \"savages,\" and see their violence against them as \"fighting terror with terror.\" I\\'m not kidding, they actually use soundbites from the last decade as part of the script. One character actually refers to the military attacks as \"shock and awe.\" If you don\\'t want to heave from the vertigo-inducing sweep of the completely sterile computer-created world of Pandora, the dialog will surely get you to bending over the toilet cursing the day you ever thought this was worth even half its price tag.See, there was a movie made very recently that dealt with valid socio-political issues that was full of interesting characters and top-notch CGI at a fraction of \"Avatar\\'s\" cost. It was called \"District 9\" and if you haven\\'t seen it, do so and then come tell me what you thought of \"Avatar.\" Because the former film was able to show the evils of racism without painting its characters as one-dimensional caricatures. It showed that greed knew no color boundaries, and that you can combine action with a message and not be beaten over the head with it.I would advise people to avoid this film, however I know that is next to impossible. This has become the new \"Titanic,\" where seeing it is not only an option, but a requirement with some groups of people. I like to refer to those people as \"STUPID.\"',\n",
       "  'Yes, I was able to see an advanced screening of James Cameron\\'s long awaited science fiction film, Avatar.So, what\\'s good about it? The visuals are among the best ever seen, the planet Pandora truly comes alive, and the creatures, wildlife, etc. All look fabulous on the big screen.What\\'s bad about it? Cameron\\'s trademark lame dialog is back, as well as his less than ordinary scriptwriting. The characters, with the exception of Signorey Weaver\\'s scientist character, and Stephen Lang\\'s Colonel Quarritch all feel wooden. The hero doesn\\'t feel alive, he feels generic, and I felt the bad guys \"humans\" were cardboard caricatures. Not to mention the story is far from original. It\\'s basically Dances With Wolves/ Pocahontas meets Aliens.What\\'s the story about? (SPOILERS AHEAD!) In the future, Marine soldier, Jake Sully, (Played by Austrailian Sam Worthtington) is a paralyzed veteran, whose twin scientist brother was killed. The Resources Development Association, a greedy energy corporation, similar to the one used in Cameron\\'s Aliens film gives him an opportunity to take his brother\\'s place in the Avatar program designed by the RDA to infiltrate the natives of Pandora called the Navi, who stand ten feet tall, have blueish skin and act like Native Americans, plus they speak English. (What a surprise!) The RDA have brought in a group of marines led by the evil Colonel Miles Quarrich, easily the most interesting character of the entire film, to make sure that the Navi are displaced from their home so that the RDA can extract a mineral called \"Unobtainium\", which is worth $20,000,000 an ounce, since the Earth is in an energy crisis. The film has some of the greatest visuals ever recorded on film, but after a while your eyes can get a little exhausted from seeing every little detail in 3D. After Jake\\'s introduction to the Navi by \"driving\" his Avatar body, the film slows down as Jake and his new found love, Neitri, played by Zoe Saldana, fall in love, and Jake discovers how the Navi tribe works. But, time is running short, Quaritch and the RDA want to displace the Navi, by force if necessary, to mine the unobtainium from the Navi grounds.The ending involves marine equipment of every sort, gunships, robotic suits, etc, all while the Navi face them down with flying dragons, dinosaurs, bows, arrows, etc. It\\'s one of the grandest visual effects scenes ever put on film.All in all, how did I feel about this film? Well, it\\'s certainly an improvement over Cameron\\'s previous entry Titanic, but his clunky dialog, and shoddy storytelling are still present, and most of the characters really aren\\'t fleshed out very well. Worthington\\'s Sully doesn\\'t really feel alive, Saldana\\'s Neitri is basically Sully\\'s Navi love interest with little to do. Giovani Ribisi\\'s greedy corporate shrill, Parker Selfride, is a whiny irritant, and Michelle Rodriquez, plays a sympathetic marine pilot who does little in the film. Only Weaver\\'s Dr. Grace Augustine and Stephen Lang\\'s Quarritch stand out among the crowd. Where Cameron succeeds is in the technical aspects of the film, the visuals, by Peter Jackson\\'s effects company WETA digital, are first rate. Also, most of the action feels unoriginal since we have seen a lot of this material in Cameron\\'s far superior Aliens film. Plus, it never even comes close to reaching the heights of his best film, 1991\\'s Terminator 2 Judgement Day. Plus as I said earlier the dialoge is borderline retarded, hearing lines out of Quaritch\\'s mouth is so bad, I was hoping for some cotton balls for my ears every time I heard one of his annoying speeches. Not to mention the logical thing for the RDA to have done was to negotiate with the Navi for the unobtainium instead of taking it by force, but then again, Cameron doesn\\'t want to use logic, he sees corporations as the ultimate evil. Very little gray in this film. The RDA is evil and the Navi are good, end of story.Would I see this again? Maybe, maybe not, but the slower aspects of the film and some of the dialog are very irritating to listen to. My wife actually got a migraine headache from wearing those 3D glasses for over two and a half hours.To sum it all up, the visuals shine, the story lags, and the dialog is awful.Avatar is not bad, but not great either. I would say it\\'s average.']}"

       "\"Among the thousands of films I have viewed, this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment. That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun.The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day, but now about 10 years later, it's no big deal. In fact, some of it, such as the lion, look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that's out there now. To me, it was story that was the lure, anyway, not the special effects.Because it's so much fun, this is one of the fastest-moving films I've ever viewed. The time flies by. It's not to be analyzed or given much thought, because it's so ludicrous. You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way. That's one of the big attractions of this of film: the excellent combination of adventure and comedy.Are there annoying things in this movie? Sure. To me, it was Bonnie Hunt's occult beliefs and too many OMGs and the overdone character of the hunter (Jonathan Hyde). Other than that, I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward. I've probably viewed this movie as much as any, simply because it was so entertaining.Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with. Now THIS is entertainment!\""
